# Financial Twitter Sentiment Analyzer ðŸ“ˆ

## Overview

The **Financial Twitter Sentiment Analyzer** is a Streamlit-based web application that helps users analyze the sentiment of financial discussions on Twitter. The app fetches tweets related to specific financial topics (stocks, crypto, market trends, etc.) and performs sentiment analysis using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
